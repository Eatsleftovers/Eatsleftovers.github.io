I ask Companies looking for a candidate that will seek to understand the systems that your organization is responsible for, make meaningful improvements, and collaborate/share knowledge with peers to improve the organization to get in touch with me. I am seeking opportunities such as these to develop my current skills in IT, Software Development, Linux Administration, Industrial automation, Cybersecurity, and Robotics & Maintenance engineering.
