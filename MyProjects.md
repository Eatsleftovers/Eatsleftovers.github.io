### Projects ive contributed to: 
- Amazon Transportation company, gate transaction automation project R4G (remote for gate). This project is rolling out to Amazon fullfilment centers to better automate gate logistical transactions performed between Amazon and Truck drivers & truck driver logistic companies. In short, from the ground up, ive installed, configured, and optimized the hardware associated with this project at 8 amazon sites. CLT2, CLT3, CLT4, CLT5, CLT6, CLT9, GSP1, and CAE1 are the sites I was responsible for. The sites that I built this entire system out at are CAE1, CLT3, CLT4, and paritially at CLT9, CLT2, and CLT5 before moving to another team. This includes project management with various internal Amazon teams, and vendors. Relocating fencing, installing concrete pads, pavement line painting, and installing conduit for network cables are just to name a few. I became closely familiar and passionate about linux during my time here working with ubuntu servers and raspberry pi IoT devices. Ive developed Bash, powershell, and python scripts to better develop baselines and monitoring on the devices I was responsible for. These systems were deeply incorporated with AWS services which I also had the opportunity to become familiar with alongside my mentorship with one of the software developers for a team I worked closely with. I was able to suggest improvements to the codebase that directly improved license plate reading software for all EU sites. As well as improve standards for NA sites in relation to the default zoom these cameras were set at.
